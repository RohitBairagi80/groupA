    <h1>6 Of The Most Frequently Asked Fitness Questions</h1>
    <hr />
    <h3>1. Which diet is the best to follow?</h3>
    <p>

        The real solution to healthy dietary intake is to find a balanced, non-restrictive eating plan that you find
        easy to
        sustain. This way you will be able to maintain your ideal weight.
    <h3>2. If I stop training will my muscles turn to fat?</h3>
    <p>This is a very common and understandable misconception. I think it has arisen through anecdotal evidence of big
        guys who have stopped training and quickly slipped from being muscular to fat.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Is walking or running better for fat loss?</h3>
    <p>This is always a difficult question to field, as there's a lot of debate around the subject. It bears working
        through.</p>
